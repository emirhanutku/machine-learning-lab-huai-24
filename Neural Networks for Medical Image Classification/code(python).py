# # AIN313: Introduction to Machine Learning - Assignment 3
# 
# # Part I: Theory Questions
# 1. **What are activation functions, and why are they important in neural networks?**
# 
# #### What are Activation Functions?
# 
# *Activation functions are mathematical operations applied to a neuron's output to introduce non-linearity and decide whether the neuron should activate. They transform the weighted sum of inputs into an output that is passed to the next layer.*
# 
# #### Why are Activation Functions Important?
# 
# - **Introduce Non-Linearity**:  
#   Allow neural networks to model complex, non-linear relationships.
# 
# - **Enable Backpropagation**:  
#   Provide gradients for weight updates during training.
# 
# - **Control Output**:  
#   Map outputs to specific ranges (e.g., probabilities or [-1, 1]).
# 
# - **Prevent Vanishing Gradients**:  
#   Modern functions like ReLU help avoid small gradients, ensuring effective training.
# 
#        
# 
# 
#    
# 
# 2. **Convolutional Neural Network: Layers and Parameters**
# 
# | Layer         | Output Volume Shape      | Number of Parameters |
# |---------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
# | **Input**     | 64 × 64 × 3       | 0                     |
# | **CONV5-8**   | 60 × 60 × 8       | 608                   |
# | **POOL-2**    | 30 × 30 × 8       | 0                     |
# | **CONV3-16**  | 28 × 28 × 16      | 1,168                 |
# | **POOL-3**    | 13 × 13 × 16      | 0                     |
# | **FC-30**     | 30                | 81,150                |
# | **FC-5**      | 5                 | 155                   |

# ## Data Preprocessing and Preparation

# ### 1. Importing Necessary Libraries
# 
# In this step, we'll import the libraries required for loading and preprocessing data. Since we are using both **NumPy** for the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and **PyTorch** for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we'll import the libraries accordingly.

# ### Displaying Sample Images from Dataset
# 
# #### Purpose:
# To visually inspect the dataset and confirm its structure and quality, a function was implemented to display sample images from each class (`benign` and `malignant`) in the training dataset.

# ### Creating Data Loaders
# *Since the batch size is fixed at 16 for the MLP experiments, we'll create DataLoaders accordingly.*

# In[10]:

# ### Preparing Data for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
# *We will use PyTorch's ImageFolder class.*

# **For CNNs, it's common to include data augmentation to improve generalization.**

# In[43]:


# Define transforms including data augmentation

    transforms.Resize((300, 300)),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.RandomRotation(10),
    transforms.ToTensor(),  # Converts image to PyTorch tensor and scales pixel values to [0, 1]
])


# In[44]:


# Training dataset
train_dataset_cnn = ImageFolder(root='311PA3_melanoma_dataset/train', transform=transform_cnn)

# Testing dataset

# ### Using PyTorch DataLoader for Batch Management
# 
# #### Purpose:
# To efficiently manage mini-batch loading for both training and testing datasets using PyTorch's `DataLoader`. This approach enables experimentation with different batch sizes and improves training efficiency.
# 

# In[46]:


batch_sizes = [16, 32]

# ### Handling Class Imbalance
# 
# *Since the dataset is relatively balanced, we might not need to apply class imbalance techniques. However, it's good practice to check the distribution.*

# ### Impact of Learning Rate
# 1. **Learning Rate = 0.005**:
#    - This learning rate shows consistent performance across different configurations.
#    - **Sigmoid Activation**:
#      - Smaller input sizes (50x50) achieve similar performance to larger input sizes (300x300), with accuracy around 87%.
#    - **ReLU Activation**:
#      - Large input size (300x300) underperforms significantly, achieving only 60.96% accuracy, possibly due to overfitting or optimization issues.
#      - Smaller input size (50x50) performs better with accuracy close to 88%.
# 
# 2. **Learning Rate = 0.02**:
#    - Higher learning rates lead to less consistent performance.
#    - **Sigmoid Activation**:
#      - Smaller input size (50x50) achieves slightly lower accuracy (85.84%) than with a lower learning rate.
#      - Larger input size (300x300) suffers significantly (67.26% accuracy), likely due to unstable updates causing divergence.
#    - **ReLU Activation**:
#      - For smaller input size (50x50), performance is competitive (87.45% accuracy), but larger input size (300x300) suffers from high test loss variability (80.69% accuracy).
# 
# ---
# 
# ### Impact of Input Size
# 1. **Smaller Input Size (50x50)**:
#    - Performs consistently across all configurations with both activation functions.
#    - Lower computational cost makes it robust to overfitting.
#    - Sigmoid and ReLU show similar performance trends, with slightly better F1-scores for ReLU.
# 
# 2. **Larger Input Size (300x300)**:
#    - Performance is highly dependent on the activation function and learning rate.
#    - ReLU with a high learning rate (0.02) performs better than Sigmoid, but instability is observed in loss curves.
#    - Sigmoid tends to underperform with larger input sizes due to optimization challenges and potential gradient saturation.
# 
# ---
# 
# ### Impact of Activation Functions
# 1. **Sigmoid**:
#    - Performs reasonably well with smaller input sizes, achieving balanced precision and recall.
#    - Struggles with larger input sizes, especially with higher learning rates, likely due to the vanishing gradient problem.
# 
# 2. **ReLU**:
#    - Outperforms Sigmoid for smaller input sizes, especially with lower learning rates.
#    - Faces challenges with large input sizes and high learning rates, resulting in inconsistent performance.
# 
# ---
# 
# ### Observations from Loss Curves
# - **Training Loss vs. Test Loss**:
#   - For smaller input sizes, training and test loss curves align well, indicating good generalization.
#   - For larger input sizes, test loss fluctuates significantly, especially for ReLU activation, indicating overfitting or unstable training.
# - **High Variability**:
#   - Test loss spikes in certain configurations (e.g., ReLU with a large input size and high learning rate), suggesting instability in optimization.
# 
# ---
# 
# ### Recommendations
# 1. **Optimal Configuration**:
#    - **Learning Rate**: 0.005
#    - **Input Size**: 50x50
#    - **Activation Function**: ReLU
#    - This configuration achieves a strong balance of accuracy (87.98%), precision (0.91), recall (0.83), and F1-score (0.87).
# 
# 2. **Avoid Large Input Sizes (300x300)**:
#    - Larger input sizes lead to unstable optimization and poorer generalization.
#    - If used, consider reducing the learning rate further (e.g., 0.001).
# 
# 3. **Focus on ReLU Activation**:
#    - ReLU generally outperforms Sigmoid in most configurations, especially for smaller input sizes.
# 
# 4. **Future Experiments**:
#    - Explore additional regularization techniques, such as dropout or weight decay, to address overfitting observed with larger input sizes.
#    - Experiment with adaptive optimizers (e.g., Adam) to stabilize training for larger input sizes.

# **I saw that there was overfit in some tests and added 'dropout' to CNN**
# 
# 
# ##### What is Dropout?
# - **Dropout** is a regularization technique where, during training, a fraction of neurons is randomly deactivated (set to zero) in a layer. 
# - In this model, dropout is applied after each fully connected layer using `self.dropout = nn.Dropout(p=0.1)`, where 10% of neurons are dropped during training.
# 
# #### Why Do We Use Dropout?
# - **Purpose**: Dropout prevents the model from relying too heavily on specific neurons, thus reducing overfitting.
# - **During Training**: Randomly drops neurons, forcing the model to learn more robust features.
# - **During Evaluation**: All neurons are active, and their outputs are scaled appropriately.
# 
# ##### Advantages
# 1. **Overfitting Reduction**:
#    - Dropout acts as a form of ensemble learning by training multiple sub-networks due to randomly deactivating neurons.
# 2. **Improved Generalization**:
#    - The model learns features that are more broadly applicable, leading to better performance on unseen data.
# 
# ##### Disadvantages
# 1. **Longer Training Time**:
#    - Dropout increases the number of iterations required for convergence as it introduces randomness during training.
# 2. **Risk of Underfitting**:
#    - If dropout probability (`p`) is too high, the model may fail to learn adequately due to excessive deactivation of neurons.
# 3. **Reduced Model Capacity**:
#    - By dropping neurons, the effective model capacity is reduced during training, which might not suit highly complex tasks.
# 
# #### Summary
# The addition of dropout to the fully connected layers in this CNN model improves its ability to generalize to unseen data by mitigating overfitting. However, careful tuning of the dropout probability (`p`) is essential to balance between underfitting and overfitting.

# 
# ---
# 
# ### 2. Detailed Analysis
# 
# ### Impact of Activation Function
# 
# ##### ReLU Activation:
# - Consistently outperformed Sigmoid.
# - Achieved higher accuracy (ranging from ~88% to ~90% without dropout and up to ~91% with dropout).
# - Provided better **precision, recall, and F1-score**.
# - Faster convergence and lower training and test losses.
# 
# ##### Sigmoid Activation:
# - Struggled with high training and test losses.
# - Accuracy remained around **50% to 70%**, indicating poor learning.
# - Precision, recall, and F1-score were significantly lower, sometimes zero.
# 
# **Interpretation:**
# - ReLU is better suited for deeper networks and mitigates the **vanishing gradient problem**, allowing for faster and more effective learning.
# - Sigmoid activation can cause **vanishing gradients**, making it difficult for the model to learn effectively.
# 
# ---
# 
# ### Impact of Learning Rate
# 
# ##### Learning Rate = 0.005:
# - With ReLU activation, models achieved high accuracy (~88% to ~90%) without dropout.
# - Models converged steadily over epochs.
# - With dropout, performance slightly improved, reaching up to ~91% accuracy.
# 
# ##### Learning Rate = 0.02:
# - With ReLU activation, models achieved similar or slightly higher accuracy.
# - One model showed an increase in test loss at the last epoch, indicating potential **overfitting** or **instability**.
# - With dropout, models showed improved stability and higher accuracy (~91%).
# 
# **Interpretation:**
# - A lower learning rate (0.005) allows for **gradual updates**, leading to stable convergence.
# - A higher learning rate (0.02) can speed up training but may cause the model to overshoot minima, leading to **fluctuations in loss**.
# - Dropout helps mitigate overfitting and can stabilize training with higher learning rates.
# 
# ---
# 
# ### Impact of Batch Size
# 
# ##### Batch Size = 16:
# - Slightly better performance in some cases compared to batch size 32.
# - With dropout and ReLU activation, achieved the **highest accuracy (~91.15%)**.
# 
# ##### Batch Size = 32:
# - Performance was comparable but slightly lower in some cases.
# - With dropout and ReLU activation, achieved high accuracy (~90.58%).
# 
# **Interpretation:**
# - Smaller batch sizes (16) introduce more **noise** in gradient estimation, helping the model generalize better and avoid local minima.
# - Larger batch sizes (32) provide more stable gradient estimates but may lead to less generalization.
# 
# ---
# 
# ### Impact of Dropout
# **Models with dropout (0.1) showed:**
# - Slightly higher **test accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score** compared to models without dropout.
# - Lower **test losses**, indicating better generalization to unseen data.
# - Slightly higher **training losses**, expected as dropout acts as a regularizer.
# 
# **Interpretation:**
# - Dropout prevents **overfitting** by randomly disabling neurons during training, forcing the network to learn more robust features.
# - The improved performance suggests that the original models were beginning to overfit the training data, and dropout helped alleviate this.
# 
# ---
# ### 3. Recommendations and Conclusions
# 
# - **Use ReLU Activation:**
#   - Provides better performance and faster convergence.
#   - Should be the default choice for CNN hidden layers.
# 
# - **Appropriate Learning Rate:**
#   - A learning rate of 0.005 with ReLU activation yielded stable and high performance.
#   - If using a higher learning rate (0.02), incorporate regularization techniques like dropout.
# 
# - **Employ Dropout Regularization:**
#   - A dropout rate of 0.1 improved model performance by reducing overfitting.
#   - Experiment with different dropout rates (e.g., 0.2, 0.5) to find the optimal balance.
# 
# - **Optimize Batch Size:**
#   - Batch size 16 slightly outperformed 32.
#   - Smaller batch sizes may be preferred for better generalization.
# 
# - **Monitor for Overfitting:**
#   - Pay attention to the training and test losses.
